    I will be attending ATPESC'25
---

I will be attending **[ATPESC '25](https://atpesc.org/atpesc-2025/)** this summer. (the Advanced Training Program for Extreme-Scale Computing) is an intensive, two-week training program that focuses on high-performance computing (HPC) and parallel programming. I'm looking forward to learning from experts in the field and gaining hands-on experience with cutting-edge HPC technologies.
